<p> As was discussed previously, maintaining circulating glucose levels is a metabolic priority.</p>

        <p>Gluconeogenesis is the process of making glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.  Which of the following can be used as a carbon source for the production of glucose:</p>
        <div class="wrong">Pyruvate rolls.<div class="why">It just isn't!</div></div>
        <div class="wrong">Lactate rolls.<div class="why">It just isn't!</div></div>
