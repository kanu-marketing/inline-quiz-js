Make your educational material more interesting and effective with simple inline self-check questions.  Students and sites users can check their knowledge and instantly see the results without leaving the web page.  Content creators with basic HTML knowledge can create and manage their own questions.  With a little more effort you can even string together a series of questions or reveal more content once an inline question has been answered.
