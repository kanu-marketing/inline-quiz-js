#summary Intro and basic example

= Introduction =

The Inline Quiz tool was originally created by developers at Michigan State University (specifically [http://vudat.msu.edu vuDAT]) for use in MSU's online and hybrid courses.  It was recently given an upgrade to greatly improve accessibility and offer a couple new configurable options.  The tool has traditionally been hosted on a site that is being phased out, so we decided to move it here, hoping that it might be used more.

= Example T/F Question Without Explanations =

Here's a very simple example of the syntax used to create a true/false inline quiz question:

{{{
    <div class="inline_quiz_all">
        <p>The Inline Quiz tool is really cool.</p>
        <div class="right">True.</div>
        <div class="wrong">False.</div>
    </div>
}}}


= Example Multiple Choice Question With Explanations =

Here's an example of the syntax used to create an inline quiz question with explanations:

{{{
    <div class="inline_quiz">
        <p>What state in the United States has an upper and a lower peninsula?</p>
        <div class="wrong">Hawaii</div>
        <div class="wrong">Alaska</div>
        <div class="wrong">Florida</div>
                <div class="why">Nice try, but that's not it.</div>
        <div class="right">Michigan
                <div class="why">Yes.  And the lower peninsula is shaped like a mitten.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
